== Description ==

A simple and intuitive, yet elegant and fully documented Google map plugin that installs as a widget and a short code. No limited plugin editions or limited functionality! This is the full version of this free and premium plugin, which comes packed with useful features: 

* Intuitive and user friendly interface, which makes it very easy to configure Google map. No complex configuration options. Facebook style interactive interface for managing multiple map markers
* Help tooltips enabled, which makes your configuration hassle free
* Plugin is fully documented. If help tooltips are not enough, you can always refer to the full documentation about each of the settings
* Short-code builder available, which integrated with post/page editor. In other words, you do not need
manually to type the short-code in the editor (But you can if you want to).
* The plugin auto generates unique ID for each map. In other words - unlimited maps! You do not need to specify and maintain unique map
IDs explicitly when dealing with multiple maps on the same post/page.
* The plugin offers extensive configuration options for Google map marker, controls, size, KML files, location by latitude/longitude, location by address, info windows, traffic/bike lanes and more!
* Support for custom overlays: Panoramio photos on the map (http://www.panoramio.com/), bicycle lanes and traffic info.
* Widget enabled.
* Cross browser compatible
* Loads geographic markup from a KML, KMZ or GeoRSS file hosted remotely.

Support for Google Fusion tables and fusion table queries, distance matrix are to be added in the next version, stay tuned!


Please note: 
Although I try my best to release a bug-free code, one or two may slip through. It would be so cool and I would really appreciate it if you would report any bugs to me first at http://initbinder.com/comprehensive-google-map-plugin, before reporting the plugin to be broken. I am quick to respond. 
Thanks!
