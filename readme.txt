Please note: 
Although I try my best to release a bug-free code, one or two may slip through. It would be so cool and I would really appreciate it if you would report any bugs to me first at http://initbinder.com/comprehensive-google-map-plugin, before reporting the plugin to be broken. I am quick to respond. 
Thanks!
